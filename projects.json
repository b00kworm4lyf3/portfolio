The coral forms are all generated procedurally using parameterized and recursive geometry, which lets me get a wide range of shapes and movement from a small set of reusable systems. I also built a GPU-based particle system to add depth and life to the water.",

          "content": "I implemented all the coral types as C++ classes that inherit from a shared base, which made it easy to apply consistent transforms, coloring, and texturing across different coral forms. The branching coral uses recursive geometry where the radius and length decay with each iteration—I spent a while tuning those decay values to get branches that felt organic rather than too uniform or too chaotic.\n\nThe brain coral was a fun one to figure out. I started with a spherical mesh and then modified it with layered sinusoidal noise to get those characteristic ridges and folds. For the barrel sponges, I built a parameterized fin system with controls for ripple, taper, and segmentation—being able to tweak those values and instantly see different sponge variations was really satisfying."

          "content": "Getting the underwater atmosphere to feel right took a lot of iteration. I set up a dynamic lighting system with a rotating light source to simulate the sun moving overhead, which helps sell the sense of being underwater with light filtering down from above. I also added a debug lighting mode so I could inspect geometry without the atmospheric effects getting in the way.\n\nThe exponential fog was essential for making the scene feel like it has depth—without it, distant objects looked way too crisp and the scale felt off. I added toggles for fog, particles, and different shading modes so I could quickly compare different configurations while I was developing."

          "title": "GPU Particle System",
          "content": "I built a custom particle system using VAOs, VBOs, and GLSL shaders to represent suspended matter drifting through the water. Each particle has its own seed value that I use to vary its motion, size, and color over time, which keeps things from looking too repetitive. I went with additive blending and point sprites to get a subtle glow effect—it took some experimentation to find the right balance where the particles add atmosphere without being distracting.\n\nThis was my first time implementing a particle system from scratch at the GPU level, and I learned a lot about how to structure the data to keep things performant even with a large number of particles on screen."

          "content": "I like to try to push the boundaries of any given assignment, and this one was no different. This being a beauty makeup challenge, I wanted to create a character that was beautiful, but who also had a story to tell, which brought me to the idea of the evolution of a well-loved doll. The model who helped me with this project was very young and so was the perfect fit for this idea, letting me focus on a clean beauty application without needing to do any color correcting or major facial feature changes.\n\nThe headpiece helped take this simple concept to the next level, allowing me to demonstrate my fabrication skills as well as my makeup skills. I used a heavy guage wire to create the structure, and thrifted doll heads which I glued to the wire frame. Since the dolls were all made out of different materials it took some trial and error to figure out which glues would work for each one, and I ended up using a combination of hot glue, super glue, and epoxy. One of the dolls had a veil that I wanted to keep, so I had to be careful with the super glue to make sure I didn't burn any holes in it. I also used some spray starch to stiffen the veil so it could be seen in the photos.\n\nFor the first makeup, I used a cream Kryolan base, and set it with translucent powder only under the eyes. I added a lot of blush to her cheeks and eyelids, but wanted to keep her skin very plastic looking so didn't use any highlighter. I lightly filled in her eyebrows and added a little bit of mascara, but no eyeliner.\n\nOnce we had gotten the first set of photos, it was time to update the look for the second set. I wanted this look to still be rooted in beauty, but take on a more editorial or grunge feeling, so I only changed the makeup a little bit, adding some darker lip gloss that I smeared outside her lip line and a little bit of water mixed with black eyeshadow to add a tear streak down one of her cheeks. I also used some dark brown powder to add dirt to her face, one spot on her forehead and into the creases of her eyes."
