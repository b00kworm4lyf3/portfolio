                    <p>
                        This project is a real-time coral reef I built to explore procedural geometry, lighting, and atmospheric effects. The coral forms are generated procedurally using parameterized and recursive geometry, which lets me get a wide range of shapes and movement from a small set of reusable systems. I also built a GPU-based particle system to add depth and life to the water.

                            <p>
                                I implemented all the coral types as C++ classes that inherit from a shared base, 
                                which made it easy to apply consistent transforms, coloring, and texturing across 
                                different coral forms. The branching coral uses recursive geometry where the radius 
                                and length decay with each iteration—I spent a while tuning those decay values to 
                                get branches that felt organic rather than too uniform or too chaotic.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For the brain coral I started with a spherical mesh and 
                                then modified it with layered sinusoidal noise. For the barrel sponges, I built a parameterized fin system with controls 
                                for ripple, taper, and segmentation which can be tweaked to make sponges that don't all look exactly the same.

                            <h3>Lighting, Atmosphere, and Controls</h3>
                            <p>
                                Getting the underwater atmosphere to feel right took a lot of iteration. I set up a dynamic lighting system with a rotating light source to simulate the sun moving overhead, which helps sell the sense of being underwater with light filtering down from above. I also added a debug lighting mode so I could inspect geometry without the atmospheric effects getting in the way.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The exponential fog was essential for making the scene feel like it has depth. Without it, the image I chose for my 'sky sphere' overtook the scene rather than adding to it. I added toggles for fog, particles, and different shading modes so I could quickly compare different configurations while I was developing. Those kinds of debug tools ended up saving me a lot of time.

                            <p>
                                I built a custom particle system using VAOs, VBOs, and GLSL shaders to represent suspended matter drifting through the water. Each particle has its own seed value that I use to vary its motion, size, and color over time, which keeps things from looking too repetitive. I went with additive blending and point sprites to get a subtle glow effect.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This was my first time implementing a particle system from scratch at the GPU level, and I learned a lot about how to structure the data to keep things performant even with a large number of particles on screen.
