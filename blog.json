The power supply module is a voltage regulator that can convert the 9V to 5V and 3.3V, this allows us to power our LED using lower voltage through the power supply output pins. The power supply connects to the breadboard and once we've connected the battery we can measure the voltage coming through each side of the power supply in order to double check that it is properly converting from 9V. We had to get a few extra hands involved to measure this properly and also take a picture, it was a pretty fiddly process!"

In order to do this I put the LED before the button, with its cathode connected to ground. When the button is not pressed the circuit is complete and the LED lights up, but when the button is pressed it redirects the current through the button instead and turns the LED off. This demonstrates an XOR gate, where the LED is on when the button is not pressed and off when it is. I had fun solving this but also it was really frustrating because I was being dumb and kept trying to put the button before the LED."
