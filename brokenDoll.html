                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>I created this makeup as the final project for the hair and beauty section of the
                        Master Makeup Artist program at The Art of Makeup in Portland, Oregon. The project
                        was to create a character that could evolve halfway through the photoshoot, so 
                        we would end up with photos of a distinct character with a story that had been told through
                        two different makeup looks. I came up with the idea of a doll that started loved and glowing,
                        and then ended up broken, dirty, and abandoned in a pile of other dolls.

                            <p> I like to try to push the boundaries of any given assignment, and this one
                                was no different. This being a beauty makeup challenge, I wanted to create 
                                a character that was beautiful, but who also had a story to tell, which brought 
                                me to the idea of the evolution of a well-loved doll. The model who helped me 
                                with this project was very young and so was the perfect fit for this idea, letting
                                me focus on a clean beauty application without needing to do any color correcting 
                                or major facial feature changes.<br><br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The headpiece helped take this simple concept to the next level, allowing me to
                                demonstrate my fabrication skills as well as my makeup skills. I used a heavy
                                guage wire to create the structure, and thrifted doll heads which I glued to
                                the wire frame. Since the dolls were all made out of different materials it took
                                some trial and error to figure out which glues would work for each one, and I ended
                                up using a combination of hot glue, super glue, and epoxy. One of the dolls had a 
                                veil that I wanted to keep, so I had to be careful with the super glue to make
                                sure I didn't burn any holes in it. I also used some spray starch to stiffen the veil
                                so it could be seen in the photos.<br><br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For the first makeup, I used a cream Kryolan base, and set it with translucent powder
                                only under the eyes. I added a lot of blush to her cheeks and eyelids, but wanted to
                                keep her skin very plastic looking so didn't use any highlighter. I lightly filled in 
                                her eyebrows and added a little bit of mascara, but no eyeliner. <br><br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once we had gotten the first set of photos, it was time to update the look for the second set.
                                I wanted this look to still be rooted in beauty, but take on a more editorial or grunge feeling, 
                                so I only changed the makeup a little bit, adding some darker lip gloss that I smeared outside 
                                her lip line and a little bit of water mixed with black eyeshadow to add a tear streak down one 
                                of her cheeks. I also used some dark brown powder to add dirt to her face, one spot on her 
                                forehead and into the creases of her eyes.
